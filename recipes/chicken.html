    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        One of our go-to recipes for chicken breast that we make often during the week<br> 
        because it's so easy. Chicken breast gets marinated in Mediterranean flavors like<br>
        lemon juice, olive oil, and herbs and then baked in the oven.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on all sides and place in a bowl or<br> 
            lidded container. Combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and thyme in a<br>
            small bowl and pour marinade over chicken breasts. Marinate for 10 minutes at<br> 
            room temperature.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set one oven rack about 6 inches<br>
            from the heat source.
        </li><br>
        <li>Place chicken breasts into a baking dish and pour marinade on top.</li><br>
        <li>
            Bake chicken on the middle rack of the preheated oven until no longer pink in<br>
            the center and the juices run clear, 35 to 45 minutes, depending upon thickness.<br>
            Move baking dish to the top rack and broil chicken until well browned, about 5<br>
            minutes.
        </li><br>
    </ol>
